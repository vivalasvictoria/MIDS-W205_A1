The score used to determine which hospitals were the best models of high quality care is made up of 
the sum of score rankings for both care and readmissions measures. Each measure is assigned a ranking
based on all of the scores. The rankings are then summed for each hospital. This approach 
incorporates the variety of procedures as well as the greatness of the scores. It doesn't necessarily favor
either more than the other.
