The score variance was used to determine which procedures had the greatest variability. This was calculated
using the population variance of the care dimension scores for each measure. The results were ordered
by variance across all measures. This method is a consistent and straightforward way to measure variance
that isn't as drastically affected by extreme values (such as range calculations, for example).
